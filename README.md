# Simple REST API with Java, Spring, and JPA

A project to support testing of the APIs I build with the "Learn REST API with Java, Spring, and JPA" course https://callibrity.udemy.com/course/rest-api-with-java-spring-boot-spring-data-jpa-jparepository-swagger/

I'm using Java 19 (I'm using Liberica JDK) and initialized a Spring Boot project using Spring 3.0.0 and Grade for build and dependency management.
